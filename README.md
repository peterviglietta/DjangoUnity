# DjangoUnity
This is a prototype of a Django app that makes API calls to Allscripts 'Unity' API. This was never used in production but it was a working prototype that successfully connected to the Allscripts Developer Program test servers, performed the API call, returned data, saved it into the Django project's SQLite database and dumped it into a web page. The Unity call in question 'GetOrders' pulls order data from the EMR database (lab orders, radiology orders etc).

The comments / notes / documentation within the code is admittedly sloppy. This is just meant as a sample to demonstrate my working knowledge of Python, Django, JSON and model view controller architecture.
